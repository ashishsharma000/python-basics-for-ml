## How Python Code Runs on a Computer

"""To understand Python properly, it is important to know **how Python code is executed internally**."""

### Step-by-Step Execution Flow

"""
1. The programmer writes Python source code (`.py` file).
2. Python first **compiles the source code into bytecode** (`.pyc`).
   - This is done automatically by Python.
   - Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-independent form.
3. The bytecode is sent to the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.
4. The PVM **interprets the bytecode line by line**.
5. The Operating System helps by:
   - Managing memory
   - Handling input/output
   - Scheduling the Python process on the CPU
6. The CPU executes the instructions and the **output is produced**.
"""

### Important Points
"""
- Python is both **compiled and interpreted**
- Compilation → source code to bytecode
- Interpretation → bytecode executed line by line
- The programmer never manually handles `.pyc` files
